# Basics Delphi

*Read this in other languages:* **[English](README.en.md)**, *[Русский](README.md)*.  
Discipline: *Fundamentals of design programs*.  
Sources projects involve launch of IDE Borland Delphi 7.  
The health of sources in other IDE has not been verified.

## Tasks:
1. *Vectors*:
  * 1.1. Given integer vector А(n). Count how many times the maximum vector largest number;
  * 1.2. Given integer vector А(n). Find the greatest number of even and odd numbers vector;
  * 1.3. Given integer vector А(n). Sort the elements of a linear method of choice with the computation;
2. *Matrix*:
  * 2.1. Given real matrix of dimension (n x n). If the maximal elements of three columns exceeds the amount of the minimum line items, then to the elements on the diagonal side add the maximal elements of three columns. Otherwise, the matrix remain unchanged.
  * 2.2. Given real matrix of dimension (n x n). Identify work items in those rows that do not contain elements of multiples of '3';
  * 2.3. Given real matrix of dimension (n x n). Find the number of the first column, do not contain elements that are less than 's';
  * 2.4. Given real matrix of dimension (n x n). Check whether the elements are ordered rows of the matrix. If not, arrange them in ascending order by the method of linear selection with calculation;
3. *Strings*:
  * 3.1. In the given text to find words that end with the same letter as the first word;
  * 3.2. Select the text of the first in order of the word with the largest number of entries in it the letter 'и';
