# Basics Borland Pascal
[&lt; back](../)  
*Read this in other languages:* **[English](README.en.md)**, *[Русский](README.md)*.  
Discipline: *Basics of algorithms and programming.*  
All examples assume the source code run in the IDE Borland Paskal 7.1.  
The efficiency of the sources in other IDE has not been tested.

## Laboratory works:
1. Given vector A(n). If the smallest element of the vector A is located on an site, all items located at odd places multiplied by 2. Otherwise the vector unchanged;
2. Given square matrix A(nхn). Build a vector b where bi, i=1,…,n – the arithmetic mean of the positive elements of the i-th row of the matrix.

## Control work:
* 1.1. Given an integer vector A(n). Count how many times found in this vector maximum highest number;
* 1.2. Given an integer vector А(n). Find the maximum of number of even and odd numbers of the vector. Printing issue original vector and the result;
* 1.3. Given an integer vector А(n). Sort the elements of a linear method of choice with the computation;
* 2.1. Given the float matrix dimension (n x n). If the maximal elements of three columns exceeds the amount of the minimum line items, then to the elements on the diagonal side add the maximal elements of three columns. Otherwise, the matrix remain unchanged;
* 2.2. Given the float matrix dimension (n x n). Identify work items in those rows that do not contain elements of multiples of 3;
* 2.3. Given the float matrix dimension (n x n). Find the number of the first column, do not contain elements that are less than 's';
* 2.4. Given the float matrix dimension (n x n). Check whether the elements of the rows of the matrix are arranged. If not, then arrange them in ascending order by the linear selection with counting;
* 3.1. In the given text to find words that end with the same letter as the first word;
* 3.2. Select the text of the first in order of the word with the largest number of entries in it the letter 'и'.
