# University study tasks
*Read this in other languages:* **[English](README.en.md)**, *[Русский](README.md)*.

This repository collected most implementations of university programming tasks on the correspondence form of training specialty POIT, GSU Francisk Skorina. Implementations include laboratory, control and practical work, graduate work and work friends from other educational institutions, in the preparation of which I was directly involved. Descriptions, in some cases, include assignments, screenshots and application deployment instructions, and presented in English (from 1st to 4th course). Translation into English was carried out with the help of online translators and may contain inaccuracies.
