What is LiveReload?

LiveReload is a tool for web developers and designers. See livereload.com for more info.

To use LiveReload, you need a client (this script) in your browser and a server running on your development machine.

This repository (livereload.js) implements the client side of the protocol. The client connects to a LiveReload server via web sockets and listens for incoming change notifications. When a CSS or an image file is modified, it is live-refreshed without reloading the page. When any other file is modified, the page is reloaded.

The server notifies the client whenever a change is made. Available servers are:

LiveReload app for Mac
rack-livereload
guard-livereload
grunt-contrib-watch
more available on Google :-)
you can even write your own; refer to the LiveReload protocol
If you are a web developer looking to use LiveReload, you should refer to your LiveReload server/app/tool's documentation, rather that this repository. You should use the copy of livereload.js script bundled with your server, because it's guaranteed to be compatible, and may be customized for that server.

Most LiveReload server vendors will serve livereload.js on the LiveReload port. When your server is running, you can typically access the script at http://0.0.0.0:35729/livereload.js.
